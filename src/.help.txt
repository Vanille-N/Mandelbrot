This is the help file for the Mandelbrot creator.
It is not recommended to modify it.

<SCOPE>
Printing help for keyword `scope`

`scope` allows to change current scope.

Syntax:
    | scope ?
        print help for `scope`
    | scope {scope}
        change scope to {scope}
    | scope .
        reset scope (equivalent to `scope nil`)
<END>

<MAP>
Printing help for keyword `map`

`map` is used to choose the color scheme to be used.
All color schemes are used in the same way:
one point is colored with the corresponding RGB values modulus
the color map length. Any number of loops may show depending on
pixel resolution.
Color 0 is to be used for points that do not diverge.

Syntax:
    | ?
        print help for `map`
    | .
        reset settings for scope `map`
        (equivalent to `0`)
    | :{int}
        select map number {int}
    | ls :{int}!
        show {int}'th page, default is 0.
<END>

<SAVE>
Printing help for keyword `save`

To avoid having to recreate all settings, files can be created
in order to restore environment to a previously set state.

Syntax:
    | ?
        print help for `save`
    | #
        hash new unique filename and save settings.
    | '{str}
        create file named {str}, and use it to save settings
    | :{int}
        load {int}'th file
    | ls :{int}!
        show {int}'th page, default is 0.
<END>

<REC>
Printing help for keyword `rec`

Change view rectangle.

Syntax:
    | ?
        show help for `rec`
    | .
        reset settings for `rec`
    | ls
        show current settings
    | ({selector}*{indicator}*{quantifier}*)*
        apply changes to the view
<END>

<MAKE>
Printing help for keyword `make`

Create image of the Mandelbrot set.

Syntax:
    | ?
        show help for `make`
    | .
        reset `make` settings
    | ls :{int}!
        show all files already created
        (page {int}, default 0)
    | :{int}
        set resolution to {int}
    | #
        hash new name and create file
    | '{str}
        use {str} as name
    | :{int} #
    | :{int} '{str}
        execute sequentially as above
<END>
