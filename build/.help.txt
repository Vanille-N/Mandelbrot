This is the help file for the Mandelbrot creator.
It is not recommended to modify it.

For color support:
$x...$   where `...` is the text that should be colored and `x` is one of:
- b (B)         blue
- r (R)         red
- y (Y)         yellow
- p (P)         purple
- k (K)         black
- e (E)         grey
- g (G)         green

`&` is an alias for `$$`
Everything that is outside of <XXXX> ... <END> will be ignored.

<MAP>
Printing help for scope `$Bmap$`

`$bmap$` is used to choose the color scheme to be used.
All color schemes are used in the same way:
one point is colored with the corresponding RGB values modulus
the color map length. Any number of loops may show depending on
pixel resolution.
Color `$y0$` is to be used for points that do not diverge.

Syntax:
    | $Y.$
        $preset settings for scope `&bmap&p`
        $p(equivalent to `&y0&p`)
    | $R{int}
        $pselect map number &r{int}
    | $Yls
    | $Yls &R{int}
        $pshow &r{int}&p'th page, default is `&y0&p`

<SAVE>
Printing help for scope `$Bsave$`

To avoid having to recreate all settings, files can be created
in order to restore environment to a previously set state.

Syntax:
    | $Y#
        $phash new unique filename and save settings
    | $Y'&R{str}
        $pcreate file named &r{str}&p, and use it to save settings
    | $R{int}
        $pload &r{int}&p'th file
    | $Yls
    | $Yls &r{int}
        $pshow &r{int}&p'th page, default is `&y0&p`
